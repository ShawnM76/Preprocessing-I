      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I am 27 years old and been working every day of my life since I have been 14 years old. Every goal I have set for myself I have achieved even if I failed a couple times before. One example is I achieved owning a house at the age of 24 and started my family. They are my biggest accomplishment in life and they are the reason I dont fail. I have succeded in multiple roles as a leader in my carreer and exceeded my upper managments expectations.   </p>
